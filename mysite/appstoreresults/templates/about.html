                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Before the ink was dry on the Supreme Court’s June 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, millions of American women and people with uteruses became concerned about the fate of their reproductive rights. Amongst the chaos and dismay in the immediate aftermath of the ruling, people began to question how mobile applications which collect reproductive health information, such as period and pregnancy trackers, would handle the data that they had accumulated. With abortion becoming illegal in state after state, many fear that the information entrusted to these apps and services may be used by law enforcement or other entities to persecute and victimize people based on their private health information.

                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">CODE V WADE is a two-part solution approach to this complex landscape. In part one, we have thoroughly assessed user concerns and gathered the data that will inform our service. This research is absolutely essential to inform how we assess the security and privacy of different apps connected to reproductive health data. Understanding relevant, specific user concerns allows us to apply a machine learning approach to understanding the effectiveness of the stated app data privacy policies. This machine learning approach applies natural language processing (NLP) to the privacy policies of dozens of reproductive healthcare apps. The output of our analysis will be a decisive ranking for each individual app according to how effectively it protects user privacy.

                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">We are taking two approaches to address this. In the short-term, we are running an automated GREP search on the output of the unchanged polisis using a python script to identify reproductive attributes that were tagged by polisis. We employ polisis first because using REGEX alone was not adequate to filter out uses of words that were not in the correct context. This is in the file nlregex.py</p>
                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">The longer-term approach we are taking is tuning the parameters of the CNN itself. In particular, we have focused on the weights matrix in the CNN attributes notebook. This has been attempted but has been met with no improvement thus far. However, the expectation is for this to take several weeks to see if there has been any change.</p>

The primary block for us is running this in production. We originally planned to do so via connection from our server the the UIUC server, but we learned just last week that it was down for maintenance. We have addressed this issue by running it on google Colab but we have run into “configuration errors” using collab that were not present on the earlier servers. Given that we encountered this issue with UIUC servers less than a week ago, we are making the ability to run this program on collab a top priority.Our current demo is based on tags outputted from a grep of the original polisis outputs on these policies</p>
